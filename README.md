# Homework #3: Collaborative Data Wrangling & EDA

Minimal scaffolding for the assignment. Fill in dataset choice, cleaning steps, and EDA later.

## Dataset
- Source: TODO (add link and date accessed)
- Description: TODO (variables, time range, units)

## How To Use
- Place raw data in `data/raw/` (kept out of version control).
- Put cleaned/derived data in `data/cleaned/`.
- Add analysis code in `notebooks/eda.ipynb` or new notebooks.

## Collaboration
- Each partner: create a branch, make commits, open a PR.
- Intentionally create/resolve one small conflict (e.g., edit this intro).
